                    <p>A garage door spring balances the weight of a garage door and enables easy movement - opening and closing manually or
                    automatically. It is made of high-tension steel, which has a limited lifespan and loses its effectiveness with time.
                    Garage door springs have different quantity levels such as ‘10,000-use’ or ‘75,000-use’. Many buyers feel that this
                    is quite a large number but when you evaluate and analyze, you will realize that a garage door is probably opened four
                    to five times a day, every day, every year justifying the high quantity levels.</p>
                    <p>How do you know that you need a garage door spring repair?</p>
                    <p>As your garage door ages, it becomes less effective. The steel loses resiliency and the door begins to weigh more.
                      When springs are brand new, you just need around 10 pounds of force to lift and open the door. But when springs move
                      towards the end of their lifespan, owners need to apply more force to lift the door, almost as much as the door’s weight</p>
