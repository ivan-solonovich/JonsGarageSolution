      <p>Apart from the frustrations caused by garage door off track, serious injuries and property damage may be incurred.
        It is advisable not to forcefully pull a jammed door down, as this bends the vertical tracks and popping out of
        the rollers from the track, leading to serious damage</p>
      <p>Failure to maintain your garage door in a timely manner will certainly lead to serious damage. Breakage of the
        springs used with the motor may not be noticeable. If only one spring breaks, the rated weight of the garage
        door will increase by 70%. In this situation, the motor will operate at its maximum power.
        There are situations where two springs break at the same time. Accordingly, the motor cannot operate
        at maximum power for a long time.</p>
      <p>In this situation, the middle part of the top panel will become deformed. This breakdown is called banded door.
        The repair is simple but expensive. It is necessary to apply strut reinforcement along the entire length of the panel.</p>
