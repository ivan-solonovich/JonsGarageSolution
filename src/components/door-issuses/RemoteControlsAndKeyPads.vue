          <p class="text-white text-xl mr-2 mb-8">All automatic garage door openers do not use the same remote control. They may have different frequencies
            but some brands may have the same frequencies if they were made by the same manufacturer.</p>
          <p class="text-white text-xl mr-2 mb-8">The best way to know which remote control matches with your garage door opener is to check the manufacturer
            and model information on the opener's motor. Garage door remotes fall into two categories:
            Standard Remotes and Universal Remotes.</p>
