    <h2 class="pb-4 text-3xl sm:text-3xl md:text-6xl text-primary">Do your garage doors exhibit any of the following:</h2>
    <ul class="points list-disc" style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;">
      <li class="ml-20">Grinding/rubbing Noises: If your garage door makes strange sounds when opening or closing, the doors could have warped (if wooden) or twisted if electrically operated.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Door jammed: Wooden doors will swell in damp, cold, or wet conditions preventing smooth opening and closing.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Jammed solid: This happens when the door comes off the track/runners.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Rapid Closing: The timing sequence needs adjusting and timed to perfection that could compromise safety or cause vehicle damage.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Slow Opening or Closing: A sluggish or slow action can make you late for that important appointment.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Door Wonâ€™t Stay Open: The doors open but then begin closing of their own accord.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Sensor Problems: Remote sensor is not activating the motor.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Damaged Hinges: Worn or loose hinges can cause a door to drop and jam.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Old and/or Damaged Door/Track Rollers: Preventing a smooth rolling action over the tracking, causing them to jam.</li>
      <li class="ml-20">Faulty Locks: Unsecure garage/roller doors can be a thoroughfare for burglars into a property.</li>
